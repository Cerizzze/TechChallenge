# TechChallenge
Hello,

Please find my response to exercise 1 below.

As I already explained to HR, I'm not that familiar with BDD specs and I have no clue of JSON object. But I made quite a lot of researches on the Internet to better understand this method and I tried to complete this exercise the best  I could.
As for the exercise 2, I couldn't complete at all as I have no knowledge of the followings:
* Selenium Webdriver 
* Protractor 
* Page Object Design/Model 
* JavaScript

Basically, I don't know how to code nor create/execute automated test.

Thank you in avance for your understanding,

Best,

Julie
